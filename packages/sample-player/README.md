A web audio sample player:

```js
var ac = new AudioContext()
var player = require('sample-player')(ac)
// given an snare audio into an AudioBuffer
var snare = player(audioBuffer)
var now = ac.currentTime
snare.start(now).start(now + 0.5).start(now + 1)
```

## Features

- Retrigger sample without re-creating nodes
- Stop all
- Detune

This is largely based on openmusic-sample-loader (but simpler, with test and some extra features: detune, events)

##Â Install

Via npm only: `npm i --save sample-player`
